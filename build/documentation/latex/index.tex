This is the documentation of SOMA it is intended to help to use the program. In addition it provides a documentation of the functionality of the code. So for developer working with SOMA this is a good starting point for anything. If you have nothing developed for SOMA before, please read our \mbox{\hyperlink{design}{Design Rationale}} page first.\hypertarget{index_Theoretical}{}\doxysubsection{Background}\label{index_Theoretical}
The program performs a single-\/chain in mean-\/field simulation. For further details look for the publication\+: \href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.2364506}{\texttt{ \char`\"{}\+Single chain in mean   field simulations\+: Quasi-\/instantaneous field approximation and   quantitative comparison with Monte Carlo simulations\char`\"{}, Daoulas, Kostas Ch. and MÃ¼ller, Marcus , J. Chem.\+Phys.\+2006, Volume 125, Number 18. }} ~\newline
 For details how this model is implemented in SOMA refer also the \mbox{\hyperlink{theory}{Theory}} page.\hypertarget{index_Detailed}{}\doxysubsection{Description}\label{index_Detailed}
